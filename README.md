# PyBer_Analysis


## Overview of the Analysis

For this assignment, I conducted the analyses and visualization of data from a ride-sharing company called PyBer.  The purpose was to sort, visualize, and analyze the performance, and look for trends of 3 different city types over the first half of 2019.  I visualize the results to present to the CEO and to make recommendations.



## Results

•	There are 13 times more rides in urban cities compare to rural cities 





•	The average fare per ride is 1.4 times less and average fare per driver is 3.4 times less in urban cities compare to rural cities 





•	The total fares in urban cities is 9 times higher than in rural cities and 2 times higher than suburban cities

Please note: There are few drivers and rides in rural cities with higher average fares compare to urban cities.






•	There are more total fares and revenue in urban cities rather than in suburban and rural

## Summary

While the urban cities rides make more revenue, the rural cities rides are more profitable. I would recommend focusing on improving the profitability of urban cities rides.  I would also reduce the number of drivers in urban cities.  Reducing number of drivers will increase average fare per driver.  Lastly, I recommend an additional analysis of ride durations; calculating fare averages per 1 minute and compare the value among city types.
